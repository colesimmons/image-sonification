yarn dev

### Steps

- [ ] Add p5.js
- [ ] Add ChucK
- [ ] Create a compelling sound based off of one image
- [ ] See how quickly p5 and ChucK could react to 24 fps


### Ideas

* How long should the release be? You could make an argument that the impact of an image is
    partially in how it relates to the residual impression of the previous one in the mind's eye.
* Maybe have a part of the composition be not just based on the image itself but the delta between
    it and the previous.

### Image Elements

* Hue = 
* Saturation = reverb
* Brightness = frequency
* x-position = pan
* y-position = instrument
